# NoSQL Challenge
In the first part of this challenge (NoSQL_Setup), I created a database called "UK Food" containing a collection, "establishments," by importing a JSON file. I added a new document to the collection, updated the document, then cleaned the data by converting the datatypes of several fields to integers and doubles.<br/><br/>
In the second part (NoSQL_Analysis), I analyzed the data by filtering for specific values based on hygiene scores, location, rating, and proximity to the restaurant in the document added to the database in part one. I also created a pipeline to determine which local authorities had the most establishments with a hygiene rating of zero. The results of all these queries were turned into Pandas DataFrames.
